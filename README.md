## Introduction

This repository serves as a knowledge base for my exploration of Machine Learning, covering essential concepts, algorithms, tools, and practical implementations. It's intended as both a personal reference and a resource for others interested in ML.

## Concepts

In the `docs/` directory, you will find detailed explanations of various ML concepts, including but not limited to:
- Supervised Learning (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs)
- Unsupervised Learning (e.g., K-Means Clustering, PCA)
- Ensemble Methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Model Evaluation Techniques (e.g., Cross-Validation, ROC AUC)



## Datasets

The `datasets/` directory contains datasets used in the projects or links to external sources if the datasets are too large to include directly.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks that include data exploration, model training, and experimentation with various ML techniques.

## Scripts

Reusable scripts and functions can be found in the `scripts/` directory. These scripts help with tasks such as data preprocessing, model evaluation, and feature engineering.



## Personal Notes

My personal thoughts, challenges encountered, and plans for future exploration are documented in the `Personal_Notes.md` file.

## How to Use

Explore the content freely, clone the repository, and utilize the code and resources provided. If you're new to ML, starting with the `Concepts` section will help you build a solid foundation before diving into the projects.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-KnowledgeBase.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd ML-KnowledgeBase
